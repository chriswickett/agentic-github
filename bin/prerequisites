${BOLD}Prerequisites${RESET}

Before proceeding, you need two things:

  ${BOLD}1. GitHub bot account + PAT${RESET}
     Create a GitHub machine account (e.g. yourname-bot). You can use
     plus addressing to reuse your email (user+bot@gmail.com goes to
     the same inbox as user@gmail.com).

     Then generate a fine-grained Personal Access Token on the bot account:
       - Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens > Generate new token
       - Token name: anything you like (e.g. agentic-bot) — just a label for your reference
       - Resource owner: set this to your ORG, not the bot's personal account
         (a token scoped to the bot user can't access org repos, even if the bot is a member)
         One PAT covers all repos in that org. You'd need a separate PAT for a
         different org or for personal repos.
       - After creating the token, an org admin must approve it:
         Org settings > Personal access tokens > Pending requests
       - Repository access: All repositories
       - Permissions: Contents (read/write), Pull requests (read/write), Issues (read/write), Metadata (read)
     Also note the bot's noreply email from https://github.com/settings/emails
       - It looks like: ID+username@users.noreply.github.com

  ${BOLD}2. Claude OAuth token${RESET}
     Run 'claude setup-token' in your terminal. It authenticates with your
     Claude Pro/Max subscription and outputs an OAuth token to copy.
